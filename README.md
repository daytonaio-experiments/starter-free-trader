So far the portfolio has 6 different stocks, and it alters the weight given to each stock depending on the return or risk wanted by the user.
Next steps: 
1. I am reading a book on derivatives an options trading to be able to hedge the portfolio and add complexity to the trades
  1.1 Should first develop an algorithm for pricing options of each stock
  1.2 Given the different options priced above, be able to hedge the portfolio using the different derivatives
2. Devlop a systematic trading algorithm that acts on its own
