So far:
  The portfolio has 6 different stocks, and it alters the weight given to each stock depending on the return or risk wanted by the user
  Tool to calculate the different derivatives and price the option, as well as give the wieght of options to hedge a stock

Next steps: 
1. I am reading a book on derivatives an options trading to be able to hedge the portfolio and add complexity to the trades
  1 Given the different options priced above, be able to hedge the portfolio using the different derivatives
    Should be able to hedge the whole portfolio, not only 1 stock
2. Devlop a systematic trading algorithm that acts on its own
